I am Nima Ghaffarzadeh, Computer Science student and Web developer. My github includes various repositories that contain projects from various fields. These repositories are the results of me playing around with different subjects, such as Game Development, Machine Learning, Blockchain Development, etc. At the end of this playing around I got the realization that my favorite branch is Web Development, and hence I put most of my time and focus on programming web.

My project subjects are:

- Web Development
- Blockchain Development
- Decentraland and Web3
- Game Development
- Android Development
- Computer Networks
- Data Science and Machine Learning
- Digital Design
