I am Nima, Computer Science student at Polytechnic University of Catalunya(UPC). My github includes repositories that have projects from various fields. These repositories are the result of me playing around with different subjects, such as Game Development, Machine Learning, Blockchain Development, etc. I am on a journey of learning and improving my programming skills, and I share this journey here. Aside from programming, I am interested in Economy and Investment, Psychology, Agriculture, etc. I would love to combine my programming knowledge with these fields in the future.

My projects are of the following areas:

- Web Development
- Blockchain Development
- Decentraland and Web3
- Game Development
- Android Development
- Computer Networks
- Data Science and Machine Learning
