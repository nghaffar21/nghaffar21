I am Nima, Computer Science student and Web developer. My github includes various repositories that have projects from various fields. These repositories are the results of me playing around with different subjects, such as Game Development, Machine Learning, Blockchain Development, etc. At the end of this playing around I found out that my favorite branch is Web Development, so I put most of my time and focus on programming web.

My projects are of the following types:

- Web Development
- Blockchain Development
- Decentraland and Web3
- Game Development
- Android Development
- Computer Networks
- Data Science and Machine Learning
- Digital Design
